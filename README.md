Term Project Title:
SIMPLE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS)

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a simplified database management system (DBMS) using Python. 
Students will create a system that allows users to define custom databases with variable fields and associated field 
lengths. The DBMS will enable users to add, delete, edit, view and search records within the created databases.

Key Requirements:

1. Database Creation:
 The user should be able to create a new database by specifying field names and their corresponding 
maximum lengths.
 Two files will be created for each database:
 System file: Stores the names of fields and their lengths.
 Data file: Stores the actual records in a structured format.

2. Data Manipulation:
 The system should allow the user to open any database from the already existing databases.
 The system must provide the following operations on the opened database:
 Add a record: Allow users to input data for each field, ensuring it does not exceed the specified field 
length.
 Edit a record: Provide functionality to modify an existing record.
 Delete a record: Enable users to remove records from the database.
 Display all records: Enable users to view all records from the database.
 Display a selected record: Enable users to view a selected record from the database.

3. User Interface:
 A user friendly, command-line interface (CLI) should be implemented for interacting with the DBMS, 
guiding the user through the database creation and data manipulation processes.
